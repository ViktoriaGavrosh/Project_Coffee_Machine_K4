# Project_Coffee_Machine_K4
This project created during the learning process 

This prigram is a coffee machine simulator.

☝️The program looped to terminate only if 
the user inputs "exit"☝️

The program asks the user for the desired 
option (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit), 
performs it, and all that in a loop until 
the user wants to finish:
- If user inputs "buy", the program prints 
Input string: "What do you want to buy? 
1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, 
back - to main menu:", reads a line and 
outputs line "I have enough resources, 
making you a coffee!" or "Sorry, not 
enough ...!"
- If the user writes "fill", the program 
asks them how much water, milk, coffee and 
how many disposable cups they wants to add 
into the coffee machine.
- If the user writes "take" the program 
gives all the money that it earned from 
selling coffee.
- If the user types "remaining", the program 
outputs all the resources that the coffee 
machine has.
- The program looped to terminate only if 
the user inputs "exit"
